Key points include:\n\n1. **Compositional Adjustments**: Tuning the composition of metal atoms and chalcogen atoms can improve ORR activity and selectivity. For instance, Zn atoms can optimize the adsorption of OOH* intermediates, and varying the Ni/B ratio in nickel borides can control electron transfer rates.\n\n2. **Electronic Regulation**: Altering the electronic structure of active sites can enhance ORR activity and selectivity. For example, different TM atoms can shift the d-band center of active Nb atoms, affecting ORR activity and selectivity.\n\n3. **Crystallinity Reduction**: Lowering the crystallinity of TM-based compounds can expose more electrochemically active sites and tune electronic structures, improving ORR activity and selectivity. Amorphous structures often perform better than crystalline counterparts due to unique local symmetries and exposed active defect sites.\n\n4. **Stability**: The stability of H2O2 electrosynthesis is crucial for practical applications. Compositional adjustments can enhance the durability of TM-based compounds by altering the adsorption of O* and OH* intermediates, preventing surface oxidation and corrosion.\n\n5. **Coordination Tuning**: Building coordinatively unsaturated or low-coordinated active TM centers can increase the number of electrocatalytically active sites and optimize their ability to bind O-containing intermediates.\n\n6. **Crystalline Design**: Rational crystalline design can significantly impact the electrocatalytic capabilities of TM-based compounds by exposing more active sites and tuning electronic structures.", "model_answer": "6. **Crystalline Design**: Rational crystalline design can significantly impact the electrocatalytic capabilities of TM-based compounds by exposing more active sites and tuning electronic structures."}}}

{"id": "1161", "results": {"summarization": {"model_original_answer": "The study introduces a novel flame-retardant method using catalytic polymer self-cleavage to release CO2 proactively, enhancing fire safety in flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF). By incorporating specific organic carboxylate potassium salts (K-salts), the pyrolysis process is altered to release CO2 rapidly and in substantial quantities, reducing smoke toxicity and enhancing fire safety. The method significantly improves the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and time to ignition (TTI) of FPUF, while maintaining mechanical properties. The study demonstrates that K-formate and K-malate are particularly effective, achieving high LOI values and self-extinguishing properties. The mechanism involves the catalytic decomposition of polyurethane by K-salts, leading to the early release of CO2, which extinguishes the flame and reduces the production of toxic gases.", "model_answer": "The study introduces a novel flame-retardant method using catalytic polymer self-cleavage to release CO2 proactively, enhancing fire safety in flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF).

{"id": "1162", "results": {"summarization": {"model_original_answer": "The study investigates the properties of broad Hα emitters at high redshift, focusing on their Hα line profiles, black hole (BH) masses, and galaxy properties. The analysis reveals that these emitters have broad Hα components with high line widths and broad-to-total flux ratios, suggesting they are powered by AGN activity. The study also finds that the UV luminosities of these emitters are significantly fainter than expected for their bolometric luminosities, indicating high dust attenuation.

{"id": "1182", "results": {"summarization": {"model_original_answer": "The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of experimental constraints on SMEFT operators under the hypothesis that NP couples universally to the two lightest fermion families, corresponding to a U(2)[5] symmetry acting upon them. The study scrutinizes electroweak, flavor, and collider data to derive bounds on all 124 effective operators associated with the dimension-6 SMEFT basis in the U(2)[5] invariant limit. These limits are reported in tables 2–8 as conservative lower bounds on the effective NP scale pertaining to each operator. The analysis includes the consistent inclusion of RG effects, allowing connections between observables characterized by significantly different energy scales and expressing them all in terms of UV conditions on the SMEFT WCs. The primary physics motivation is to determine whether present data are compatible with the hypothesis of new dynamics primarily coupled to the third generation of SM fermions around the TeV scale and, if so, under which UV conditions. The answer to this question is illustrated through the sequence of plots in figure 3–6. Employing only the hypothesis of exact U(2)[5] symmetry, many operator bounds still exceed several TeV. However, with additional simple assumptions, such as the mild suppression of all the operators involving light fields at the high scale, all present bounds can be reconciled with an effective scale as low as 1.5 TeV. The study also estimates the progress anticipated in the exploration of this motivated NP setup in the medium and long term, taking into account the expected progress on flavor and collider observables in the near future, as well as the potential contribution of a future circular e[+]e[−] collider. The example of rare B _Kνν¯ and K_ _πνν¯ decays is presented to illustrate the broader role of flavor-changing processes in probing this class of NP models. The study also shows the substantial impact that a future e[+]e[−] collider, such as FCC-ee, could have on EW observables, which are still dominated by LEP data. The results suggest that a future e[+]e[−] circular collider could serve as an indirect discovery machine for a broad class of NP scenarios.", "model_answer": "The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of experimental constraints on SMEFT operators under the hypothesis that NP couples universally to the two lightest fermion families, corresponding to a U(2)[5] symmetry acting upon them.

The analysis includes the consistent inclusion of RG effects, allowing connections between observables characterized by significantly different energy scales and expressing them all in terms of UV conditions on the SMEFT WCs. The primary physics motivation is to determine whether present data are compatible with the hypothesis of new dynamics primarily coupled to the third generation of SM fermions around the TeV scale and, if so, under which UV conditions. The answer to this question is illustrated through the sequence of plots in figure 3–6. Employing only the hypothesis of exact U(2)[5] symmetry, many operator bounds still exceed several TeV. However, with additional simple assumptions, such as the mild suppression of all the operators involving light fields at the high scale, all present bounds can be reconciled with an effective scale as low as 1.5 TeV. The study also estimates the progress anticipated in the exploration of this motivated NP setup in the medium and long term, taking into account the expected progress on flavor and collider observables in the near future, as well as the potential contribution of a future circular e[+]e[−] collider. The example of rare B _Kνν¯ and K_ _πνν¯ decays is presented to illustrate the broader role of flavor-changing processes in probing this class of NP models. The study also shows the substantial impact that a future e[+]e[−] collider, such as FCC-ee, could have on EW observables, which are still dominated by LEP data. The results suggest that a future e[+]e[−] circular collider could serve as an indirect discovery machine for a broad class of NP scenarios."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "10 TeV", "model_answer": "10 TeV"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['b', 'd']", "model_answer": "['b', 'd']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "a) 0.27 TeV", "model_answer": "a"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}
