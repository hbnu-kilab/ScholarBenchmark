Key findings include:\n\n1. **Private Investors**: Investors are willing to pay for sustainable investments but do not significantly increase their WTP with higher impact levels. This finding is robust across different elicitation methods and data processing protocols.\n\n2. **Impact Investors**: Even experienced impact investors do not significantly increase their WTP with higher impact levels, suggesting that experience does not drive sensitivity to impact.\n\n3. **Comparability**: When investors can compare multiple investment options, they do not show increased sensitivity to impact. This suggests that the ability to compare options does not significantly influence WTP.\n\nThe study concludes that investors' WTP for sustainable investments is driven more by their preference for sustainability rather than the specific impact level.", "model_answer": "The study concludes that investors' WTP for sustainable investments is driven more by their preference for sustainability rather than the specific impact level."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Average WTP", "model_answer": "Average WTP"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "a", "model_answer": "a"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}

{"id": "835", "results": {"summarization": {"model_original_answer": "The paragraph discusses the development and implementation of a logical processor based on atom arrays, which is designed to perform fault-tolerant quantum operations. The processor is split into three zones: storage, entangling, and readout. The storage zone is used for dense qubit storage, the entangling zone for parallel logical qubit encoding and stabilizer measurements, and the readout zone for mid-circuit readout of desired logical or physical qubits. The processor uses arrays of individual [87]Rb atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which can be dynamically reconfigured in the middle of the computation while preserving qubit coherence. The processor is capable of performing logical single-qubit and two-qubit operations transversally, with efficient, parallel operations. The processor also includes a transversal CNOT gate, which is implemented using a 2D AOD to create a grid of light beams and simultaneously illuminate the physical qubits of the logical block with the same instruction. The processor is designed to be fault-tolerant, with error-corrected operations and mid-circuit readout and feedforward. The processor is also capable of performing complex logical circuits using 3D codes, which can transversally realize non-Clifford operations. The processor is designed to be scalable, with the ability to scale circuits to larger numbers of qubits and perform repetitive error correction during a logical quantum algorithm. The processor is also capable of performing quantum simulations with logical qubits, probing entanglement properties of fast scrambling circuits. The processor is designed to be robust and efficient, with the ability to perform complex quantum algorithms with high fidelity and low error rates.", "model_answer": "The paragraph discusses the development and implementation of a logical processor based on atom arrays, which is designed to perform fault-tolerant quantum operations. The processor is split into three zones: storage, entangling, and readout. The storage zone is used for dense qubit storage, the entangling zone for parallel logical qubit encoding and stabilizer measurements, and the readout zone for mid-circuit readout of desired logical or physical qubits. The processor uses arrays of individual [87]Rb atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which can be dynamically reconfigured in the middle of the computation while preserving qubit coherence. The processor is capable of performing logical single-qubit and two-qubit operations transversally, with efficient, parallel operations. The processor also includes a transversal CNOT gate, which is implemented using a 2D AOD to create a grid of light beams and simultaneously illuminate the physical qubits of the logical block with the same instruction. The processor is designed to be fault-tolerant, with error-corrected operations and mid-circuit readout and feedforward. The processor is also capable of performing complex logical circuits using 3D codes, which can transversally realize non-Clifford operations. The processor is designed to be scalable, with the ability to scale circuits to larger numbers of qubits and perform repetitive error correction during a logical quantum algorithm. The processor is also capable of performing quantum simulations with logical qubits, probing entanglement properties of fast scrambling circuits.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Compositional Adjustments**: Tuning the composition of metal atoms and chalcogen atoms can improve ORR activity and selectivity. For instance, Zn atoms can induce electron-deficient Ni atoms, optimizing adsorption of OOH* intermediates.\n\n2. **Electronic Regulation**: Different transition metal atoms can shift the d-band center of active Nb atoms, affecting ORR activity and selectivity. The TPV technique shows that varying the Ni/B ratio in nickel borides can control electron transfer at the surface, with NiB2 exhibiting the slowest interfacial transfer kinetics.\n\n3. **Crystallinity Reduction**: Lowering the crystallinity of TM-based compounds can expose more electrochemically active sites and tune electronic structures, enhancing ORR activity and selectivity. Amorphous structures often perform better than crystalline counterparts due to unique local symmetries and exposed active defect sites.\n\n4. **Surface Stability**: The stability of H2O2 electrosynthesis is crucial for practical applications. Studies show that tuning the coordinated TM atoms can enhance the intrinsic resistance of TM-based compounds to surface oxidation and corrosion during ORR in aqueous environments.\n\n5. **Coordination Tuning**: Building coordinatively unsaturated or low-coordinated active TM centers can increase the number of electrocatalytically active sites and optimize their ability to bind O-containing intermediates.\n\n6. **Crystalline Design**: Reducing crystallinity can expose more active sites and tune electronic structures, improving both activity and selectivity of 2e[−] ORR. Amorphous structures often exhibit unique coordination symmetries and unusual electronic states of TM atoms, enhancing ORR performance.", "model_answer": "6. **Crystalline Design**: Reducing crystallinity can expose more active sites and tune electronic structures, improving both activity and selectivity of 2e[−] ORR.

The study scrutinizes electroweak, flavor, and collider data to derive bounds on all 124 effective operators associated with the dimension-6 SMEFT basis in the U(2)[5] invariant limit. The results are reported in tables 2–8 as conservative lower bounds on the effective NP scale pertaining to each operator. The analysis includes the consistent inclusion of RG effects, allowing connections between observables characterized by significantly different energy scales and expressing them all in terms of UV conditions on the SMEFT WCs. The primary physics motivation is to determine whether present data are compatible with the hypothesis of new dynamics primarily coupled to the third generation of SM fermions around the TeV scale and, if so, under which UV conditions. The answer to this question is illustrated through the sequence of plots in figure 3–6. The study also estimates the progress anticipated in the exploration of this motivated NP setup in the medium and long term, considering the expected progress on flavor and collider observables in the near future, as well as the potential contribution of a future circular e[+]e[−] collider. The example of rare B _Kνν¯ and K_ _πνν¯ decays is presented to illustrate the broader role of flavor-changing processes in probing this class of NP models. The study also shows the substantial impact that a future e[+]e[−] collider, such as FCC-ee, could have on EW observables, which are still dominated by LEP data.
