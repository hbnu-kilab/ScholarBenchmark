Like biexcitons, charged excitons (usually referred to as trions) can also undergo fast Auger-type non-radiative recombination. When the charge is removed, the QD will be turned ‘ON’ again. Such a blinking mechanism is called Auger blinking (Fig. 13(a)) and is arguably the most generic blinking mechanism in QDs. Additionally, trap states can also be photo-activated and add non-radiative recombination channels to the band-edge carriers. Such non-radiative process is usually slower than Auger recombination. As a result, the PL intensity will be attenuated but not completely turn ‘OFF’, which is reflected as a ‘gray’ state in blinking measurements. This kind of blinking is often referred to as band-edge carrier (BC) blinking (Fig. 13(a)).[159] Other blinking models such as hot carrier trapping and charge transfer have also been proposed.[158] Generally speaking, these blinking models are all related to the surface of QDs.\"\n\n\n</think>\n1", "model_answer": "1"}}}
