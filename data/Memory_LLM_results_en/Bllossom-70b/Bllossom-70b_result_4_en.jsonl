Especially since the mid-twentieth century, the age-old philosophical dualism of emotionality and rationality has been gradually made more complicated and eventually replaced by several different streams of thinking about emotions. The current philosophical thinking suggests that emotions entail not only phenomenological inner states/affections but also cognitive evaluations (they either are or are caused by cognitive evaluations) and behavioral desires. These components of emotions have porous boundaries yet are not necessarily consistent. Similarly, current neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science stress the importance of emotional experiences for reasoning and conceptual knowledge. Emotions can be understood as rational in two ways. First, they have cognitive rationality: the ability to represent the world as it is, to point to events in the world. Second, they have strategic rationality: the ability to motivate and lead to actions that promote one’s interests. In the quote above, Artem was agitated by his colleague’s disregard for the truth (cognitive rationality). Although he did not have time to explain the whole context as he wished to and almost resigned, his agitation eventually motivated him to argue about the truth (strategic rationality). Most of the local media professionals I met performed – and were required to perform – strict emotional labor, self-analyzing and compartmentalizing these different emotional parts and trying to bring order into the complex of affect, opinions, and behavior. The compartmentalization starts with the cognitive dimension of emotions, or cognitive evaluation of outer reality. Everyone knows that if local fixers and producers want to maintain credibility, there are facts they need to stick to. Naming Russia as an aggressor, it’s not about being biased, it’s a fact that is out there, as in, you know, international law. Human rights, international treaties, humanitarian law, historical facts, and verified outer reality – and others’ (dis)respect for these values and principles – motivated both local and foreign media professionals’ emotions. For example, when a Ukrainian producer saw a foreign reporter ignoring that the Russian annexation of Crimea was illegal and is not internationally recognized, they could get angry. In this way, the emotion pointed to the knower’s confidence in certain aspects of outer reality. Richard Stupart recently described a similar potential of journalists’ emotions to point to (ethical) norms/values. Moreover, these values and principles also guide the process of the compartmentalization of the three components of emotions: affect, opinion, and behavior. Locals such as Olena, Svitlana, and foreign correspondents such as Pierre or Frans relied on verified facts, international treaties, and human rights to tell the affective emotional dimension (carrying the danger of bias) from the rest of the emotional components. In turn, the research participants’ emotions also had strategic rationality: they motivated particular behavior. First, being triggered by (not) sticking to a value or a fact, the emotion (typically an unpleasant one) motivated the local research participants to insist on the value/fact and – as some saw it – help their foreign colleagues discover a world beyond clichés and lead them from ignorance. The emotion thus did motivate a certain form of ‘activism.’ However, this activism resided in the mission to tell the world what happens in a contextualized, historically, and legally informed way. But the strategic rationality was also instrumental. Since the collaboration between foreign and local media professionals often starts with the word of mouth and recommendations, anyone who wants to stay in business – build a sustainable professional image – must also stick to the compartmentalization of affect, cognition, and behavior in practice. My interviewees’ confessions that they cannot be detached – inside – were usually followed by their assurance that they can be ‘neutral outside … with the journalists’ when they work. You need a fixer that does something against his ideology. Pavlo pointed out that this emotional labor is a universal human experience: in any profession and personal life, one sometimes needs to talk to ‘simply disgusting’ people. ‘The problem in the warzone [is that] those people have guns,’ he concluded.

Current revenue models rely on advertising, but future transactions will involve diverse methods, such as selling digital assets, and require detailed permissions and tracking.\n\nSummary (English):\nThe rise of solo media creators and digital content sharing necessitates the development of core technologies for managing permissions and tracking content usage.

The participants were monitored for a median duration of 2.9 years, and the recurrence rates were comparable among the hydrochlorothiazide groups receiving doses of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg, as well as the placebo group. Therefore, these findings raise concerns regarding the prolonged use of hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stone prevention. Allopurinol should be started at 100 mg once per day and increased gradually to 100 mg three times per day. There is no evidence that combination therapy with thiazide diuretics or alkaline citrates is more effective than monotherapy. Allopurinol is one of the mainstays of therapy for patients with calcium stones, but most patients with uric acid stones have acidic urine that requires treatment with alkaline citrates. Citrate supplements are not only used for calcium stones, but also for uric acid stones (with a urine pH target of 6.0 to 7.5 or higher) and cystine stones (with a urine pH target of 7.0 to 7.5 or higher). The preferred dietary salt supplement is potassium citrate, with a target dose of 5 to 12 g per day. The starting dose should be 9 g per day, divided into three doses and taken within 30 min of a meal before bed—a snack. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal problems. Potassium citrate supplementation can correct low serum potassium levels caused by thiazide diuretics, but there is no evidence that combination therapy is more effective than either drug alone. Sodium citrate is an alternative to citrate supplementation, but the resulting excretion of sodium and calcium may partially offset the desired effect. Unsweetened soda is a tastier and less expensive alternative to citrate supplements. Although there is no direct evidence of its effectiveness in preventing stone recurrence, the dilution of lemon juice in water should help patients meet the recommended fluid intake. If medication or citrate supplementation is prescribed, serum potassium levels (for patients taking thiazide diuretics or potassium citrate) and liver enzymes (allopurinol) should be monitored to detect potentially serious adverse effects. Potassium levels should be monitored before prescription, within two weeks of prescription, and then every 12 months (earlier if illness occurs or another medication is added). Urinary acidification has been proposed for the prophylaxis of infection stones, but long-term acidification is difficult to achieve in urine infected by urease-producing bacteria. Urease inhibitors lead to the prevention and/or dissolution of stones and encrustations in patients with infection by urea-splitting bacteria, but their use is limited by their toxicity. Furthermore, the administration of citrate salts involves an increase in the value of nucleation pH (pHn). This is the pH value at which calcium and magnesium phosphate crystallization occurs, in a greater way than the corresponding increase in the urinary pH due to its alkalinizing effect and resulting in a reduction of the risk of struvite crystallization. It has been seen that Pioglitazone protects against CaOx crystals by promoting M2-like Mj polarization and decreasing renal CaOx crystal deposition and inflammatory damage in murine bone marrow-derived Mj in vitro and in CaOx nephrocalcinosis mouse models in vivo. Previous studies demonstrated that curcumin (an antioxidant) alleviated COM crystal deposition in the mouse kidney through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic activities. In addition to this, a new study was carried out about the role of vitexin in the prevention of nephrolithiasis. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of vitexin involved anti-pyroptotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and EMT suppressive activities. The results of Ding et al. confirm the protective role of vitexin in nephrolithiasis through the attenuation of NLRP3 activation and the GSDMD-related pyroptosis form of programmed cell death.
