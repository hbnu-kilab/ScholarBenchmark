This suggests that the packing density of siRNA within LNPs is heterogeneous and changes with size. The study proposes that the initial heterogeneous packing density is due to the kinetic path of LNP assembly, which involves complexation and lipid precipitation under acidic conditions, followed by dialysis and purification. The researchers used kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to support their findings, suggesting that siRNA is packed on the surface of smaller LNPs and in inverted micelles within larger LNPs, leading to varying packing densities."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Size exclusion chromatography", "model_answer": "Size exclusion chromatography"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['b', 'c']", "model_answer": "['b', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}
