The intrinsic exciton emission rate is determined by its fine structure, which can be affected by the degree of quantum confinement. The optical transition probability of the exciton is affected by the wavefunctions of both the electron at the conduction band edge and the hole at the valence band edge. Both the energy and the recombination rate of these two charge carriers depend on their spin configurations. In QDs, the fine structure of the exciton is found to split into triplet and singlet states due to electron-hole exchange interactions. The energy gap between the optically bright and dark states is only a few meV in QDs. At room temperature, all of these states are populated, and the observed exciton radiative recombination rate is a weighted average from both bright and dark excitons. At low temperature, the dark ground state is preferred, and PL emission slows down. In perovskite NCs, the PL lifetime shortens with decreases in temperature, reaching 200-300 ps at 4 K. The low-lying triplet excitons in perovskite QDs are actually bright due to the unique band structure of lead halide perovskites and Rashba effect. The triplet bright state is further split by the orthorhombic distortion in perovskite QDs into three sublevels due to their specific Goldschmidt tolerance factors. These sublevels have been directly observed by measuring the polarization-dependent single QD PL spectra: up to three excitonic PL emission lines with orthogonal polarizations were observed.

Since the 2006 revision of the Composite Economic Index, Korea has used the short- and long-term interest rate spreads as components of the leading economic index. In 2016, the long-term interest rate data was changed from a 3-year maturity to a 5-year maturity government bond. The study attempted a comparative analysis of the economic prediction power of various interest rate spreads. To do this, two period spreads were created, defined as the difference between 3-year and 5-year government bond yields and the call rate, along with a credit spread between 3-year corporate bond yields and government bond yields. According to the results of the linear regression model estimation, there were differences in leading properties depending on the spread, but they were all found to predict future economic fluctuations well. The results of the probit model analysis also showed that each spread predicts future economic turning points to some extent. In particular, the spread using the 5-year maturity yield was found to have better predictive power than the spread using the 3-year maturity yield. These results are consistent with the background of the recent revision of the Composite Economic Index by Statistics Korea, which adjusted the basic long-term interest rate data. Considering that the systematic organization of leading indicators is important for future economic forecasting, the analysis results of this study, which reexamine the usefulness of interest rate spreads, are expected to provide useful information for future operation of the Composite Economic Index. Predicting future economic conditions has a significant impact on the decision-making of economic agents. Accordingly, research to find variables that can be used for predicting future economic activity has been actively conducted. Based on the results of analyzing the predictive power of the short- and long-term interest rate spreads after the study by Stock and Watson (1989), the U.S. included the short- and long-term interest rate spreads as components of the leading economic index after 1996. Similarly, Korea also included the short- and long-term interest rate spreads as components of the leading economic index after the 2006 revision of the Composite Economic Index, making them an important information variable for economic forecasting. When introduced in 2006, the 3-year maturity government bond yield was used as the basic data for long-term interest rates, and in the 9th revision of the Composite Economic Index in 2016, the period spread derived from the difference between the 5-year maturity government bond yield and the call rate was used as a leading index component, referred to as the 'short- and long-term interest rate gap.' Meanwhile, after the foreign exchange crisis, the scale of bond issuance and circulation increased significantly, strengthening the link between the short- and long-term bond markets, and the need for improvements in the bond market system became prominent, leading to the regularization of government bond issuance in 1999, the establishment of the government bond futures market, and the introduction of the market-based bond valuation system in 2000, which greatly improved the bond market infrastructure.\n\nQuestion: \nWhich government bond yield was used as part of the short- and long-term interest rate spread in the 2006 revision of the Composite Economic Index?\n\nChoices: \na) 3-month Maturity\nb) 1-year Maturity\nc) 3-year Maturity\nd) 5-year Maturity\n\n</think>\n\nd) 5-year Maturity", "model_answer": "d"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "Cot\nThe text states that the short- and long-term interest rate spreads were included as components of the leading economic index after the 2006 revision of the Composite Economic Index.

The outlet for CaF2 crystal discharge was strategically placed above the point of reagent injection, ensuring optimal conditions for the formation of calcium fluoride crystals. The experiments were carried out under ambient temperature (25 °C) and atmospheric pressure conditions. The CaCl2 at 35% concentration was used as a reactant, and based on the desired molar ratio of [Ca[2+]]/[F[−]], this solution was injected using a peristaltic pump for 300 min in conjunction with the flow rate of the circulating water. Various experimental factors were considered to determine the optimal conditions for fluoride ion removal and calcium fluoride crystallization efficiency. These factors included hydraulic retention time (HRT), pH, the [Ca[2+]]/[F[−]] (mol/mol) ratio, seed type, seed size, seed bed height and upflow velocity. The detailed experimental conditions are presented in Table 5. For the batch experiments, the pH and HRT were varied in the range of 3 to 9 and 3 to 8 h, respectively.

This indicates the change in electrochemical activity of Ti/IrO2-NSS electrocatalysts compared to Ti/IrO2 electrodes. Moreover, the optimal voltage with high selectivity for chlorine ion oxidation is investigated. The applied voltage affects several factors, such as the ohmic contact of the heterojunction layer, electron transfer between the electrode and electrolyte, and the characteristics of the electrolyte, which influence the formation of active chlorine species, water oxidation, and pollutant degradation. At 2.0 V, 2.25 V, 2.375 V, and 2.5 V, the chlorine generation was 4.71, 7.60, 3.79, and 4.36 times higher, respectively, while the Eosin-Y degradation was 1.18, 2.15, 1.61, and 1.06 times higher, showing a significant increase in electrochemical activity with SSN doping at all voltages. The increase ratio of active chlorine species should increase with voltage, but in this study, it increased up to 2.25 V and then decreased. This is related to the difference in the starting potential of the LSV. At low voltages (2.0 V, 2.25 V), the water oxidation reaction was limited due to the competition with active chlorine generation (Fig. 6). In contrast, at high voltages (2.375 V, 2.5 V), the increase ratio of active chlorine species decreased, likely due to the generation of various products with different oxidation potentials (active oxygen species: OOH?, O2?-, H2O2, etc.), reducing the selectivity for active chlorine species. Among these, at 2.25 V, the active chlorine species was 7.6 times higher than the Ti/IrO2 electrode, suggesting the highest selectivity for active chlorine species. The degradation ability of Eosin-Y did not follow the same trend as active chlorine species generation, but at 2.25 V, the degradation ability of Eosin-Y was 2.15 times higher. This indicates that the Ti/IrO2-SSN electrode at 2.25 V minimizes the competitive reaction between chlorine ion oxidation and water oxidation.</think>\n\nActive chlorine species generation", "model_answer": "Active chlorine species generation"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "Cot\nThe addition of SnO2-Sb-Ni to the Ti/IrO2 electrode enhances the electrochemical performance by improving the electrocatalytic activity and the selectivity for chlorine ion oxidation. The intermediate layer acts as an electron transport layer, providing ohmic contact and facilitating the competitive formation of oxygen and active chlorine species. This is inferred from the reactions R3, R4, R5, and R6. The addition of SnO2-Sb-Ni promotes the adsorption of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) from water decomposition, which are then oxidized to produce active chlorine species, increasing the production of active chlorine species. The electrochemical activity is enhanced, and the degradation ability of Eosin-Y is improved, especially at 2.25 V, where the selectivity for active chlorine species is highest.

BMI is not a direct measure of body fat, but it is highly correlated with more direct measures of body fat percentage, such as underwater weighing or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMI does not distinguish between lean body mass and body fat percentage, so it may not be as accurate for individuals who have a muscular build or a high percentage of muscle mass. However, it is a simple and widely used tool for assessing weight status and is often used in conjunction with other measures to get a more complete picture of a person's health. BMI is calculated as weight in kg divided by the square of height in meters. For example, if a person weighs 65 kg and is 1.75 m tall, their BMI would be 65 / (1.75)² = 24.31.

The diagnosis varies depending on the type of calculus. Typically, laboratory tests are conducted, encompassing hematological and urinary analyses, which prove invaluable in identifying the causative factors associated with the formation of distinct urinary stone types as suggested by EAU guidelines 2023 (Table 1). For calcium-containing calculi, they are clearly visible on CT scans without contrast. For non-calcium-containing stones, cystine stones are discernible on standard X-rays due to the sulfur content of cysteine, but even with ultrasound and CT. Non-contrast CT and ultrasound can identify uric acid stones, which appear radiolucent on a plain abdominal X-ray. The current guidelines from both the EAU and the recently issued AUA guidelines now include a suggestion for stone analysis in individuals forming stones for the first time, as well as in some recurrent high-risk stone formers.

The current legal framework, such as Article 3 of the Automobile Liability Compensation Act, is based on the assumption that the driver of the vehicle is liable for accidents. However, with the advent of fully autonomous vehicles, where the vehicle operates without human intervention, the question of who should be held liable becomes unclear. The vehicle owner is often seen as the party that enjoys the benefits of the vehicle's operation and is therefore considered responsible for accidents. However, this approach may not be fair, as the vehicle owner may not have control over the vehicle's operation. Introducing a 'Fully Autonomous Vehicle Insurance System' as seen in the UK could provide a solution to ensure that victims receive compensation. The SAE classification levels (0-5) provide a framework for understanding the levels of automation, with levels 3-5 being highly automated and potentially leading to new liability challenges. The U.S. Department of Transportation's division of levels into 0-2 and 3-5 based on the primary role of the human operator or autonomous system further complicates the issue. The debate highlights the need for a clear legal framework to address the liability for accidents involving fully autonomous vehicles. The vehicle owner, the manufacturer, and the insurance company are all potential parties that could be held liable, but the current legal framework is unclear and in need of revision. The key issue is determining the cause of the accident, which is often difficult in fully autonomous vehicles. Therefore, it is necessary to store all driving records of the vehicle to determine liability. The legal system must adapt to the new technology and provide a clear and fair way to assign liability for accidents involving fully autonomous vehicles. The current legal framework is not equipped to handle the complexities of fully autonomous vehicles, and a new approach is needed to ensure that victims receive fair compensation.

Therefore, it is necessary to store all driving records of", "model_answer": "The question of liability for accidents involving fully autonomous vehicles is a complex issue that arises from the shift in control from human drivers to AI-based autonomous systems. The current legal framework, such as Article 3 of the Automobile Liability Compensation Act, is based on the assumption that the driver of the vehicle is liable for accidents. However, with the advent of fully autonomous vehicles, where the vehicle operates without human intervention, the question of who should be held liable becomes unclear. The vehicle owner is often seen as the party that enjoys the benefits of the vehicle's operation and is therefore considered responsible for accidents. However, this approach may not be fair, as the vehicle owner may not have control over the vehicle's operation. Introducing a 'Fully Autonomous Vehicle Insurance System' as seen in the UK could provide a solution to ensure that victims receive compensation. The SAE classification levels (0-5) provide a framework for understanding the levels of automation, with levels 3-5 being highly automated and potentially leading to new liability challenges. The U.S. Department of Transportation's division of levels into 0-2 and 3-5 based on the primary role of the human operator or autonomous system further complicates the issue. The debate highlights the need for a clear legal framework to address the liability for accidents involving fully autonomous vehicles. The vehicle owner, the manufacturer, and the insurance company are all potential parties that could be held liable, but the current legal framework is unclear and in need of revision.

Trends in Household Consumption"}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Cot\nHousehold income and consumption expenditure have been increasing over the long term, but their growth rates have slowed down over time. Consumption expenditure has increased at a lower rate compared to income. The GDP growth rate was 9.9% in the 1980s, 6.9% in the 1990s, 4.4% in the 2000s, and 3.0% in the 2010s, while the consumption growth rates were 8.4% in the 1980s, 6.1% in the 1990s, 3.4% in the 2000s, and 2.1% in the 2010s. During the 1998 financial crisis and the 2003 credit card crisis, the consumption growth rate was lower than the economic growth rate, but it recovered afterwards. However, following the 2009 global financial crisis triggered by Lehman Brothers, the consumption growth rate persistently lagged behind the economic growth rate. According to the World Bank, South Korea's consumption stagnation is severe compared to other OECD countries. The share of household consumption in GDP was 61.8% in 1980 but has been below 50% since 2010, lower than in the U.S. (70%), Japan (55%), and similar to Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, where social welfare is well-developed. When breaking down food expenditure into in-home meals and dining out (including institutional dining), in-home meal expenditure slightly increased in the 1980s but stabilized in the 1990s and decreased from the 2000s. Dining out expenditure rapidly increased in the 1990s but slowed down after the 2000s, maintaining a level similar to 2003. The real expenditures per household for in-home and dining out have become equal at around KRW 300,000. The share of dining out in food expenditure was significantly lower than the OECD average of 30% in 2014. Countries with high dining out shares include Ireland at 51.3%, Austria at 47.2%, the U.K., the U.S., and Greece above 40%. Japan has developed a mid-meal culture that, if included in dining out, shows a steady increase at 29.2% by 2014–2015. From 1980 to 2015, household expenditure increased from KRW 756,000 to KRW 3.335 million, more than quadrupling, while food expenditure roughly doubled over the same period. In-home meal expenditure showed little change, whereas dining out expenditure expanded from KRW 17,000 to KRW 332,000, nearly a twenty-fold increase. The average annual increase rate in household food expenditure per capita was less than half that of overall consumption expenditure and nearly stagnated after the 2000s. Food expenditure increased by 3.5% in the 1980s, 1.9% in the 1990s, but decreased by 0.1% in the 2000s and increased by 0.2% in the 2010s. As household income increased, the rise in food expenditure slowed, reflecting typical Engel's law behavior. South Korea experienced a rise in the Engel coefficient during crises like the 1998 financial crisis, 2003 credit card crisis, and 2009 global financial crisis, but overall, the coefficient decreased from 43.2% in 1980, 35.0% in 1990, 29.6% in 2000, to 27.3% in 2015, remaining stagnant since 2010. Compared to OECD countries, South Korea's Engel coefficient is relatively high. In 2014, OECD countries averaged 22.0%, while South Korea was about 5 percentage points higher. Countries with higher Engel coefficients include Mexico, Hungary, Greece, and Estonia. Japan's Engel coefficient was 24.1% in 2014 and 25.0% in 2015, increasing since mid-2000s. From 1990 to 2015, the increase rate in food expenditure was generally higher among higher-income households. For the fourth quintile households, the average annual increase rate was the highest at 1%. The lowest quintile households experienced a decrease in income, which fell by an average of 0.6% annually, while their food expenditure decreased by 1.1%, indicating a greater reduction in food spending than in income. The average consumption pattern showed greater disparity based on income level than age. The average consumption pattern varied little across age groups but decreased significantly for households headed by individuals aged 60 or older. The average consumption pattern was lower for higher-income households and exhibited higher volatility in the lowest-income households, which had significantly higher average consumption patterns. The Engel coefficient was lower for younger household heads and higher for those aged 60 or older. By 2015, households headed by individuals aged 60 or older had an Engel coefficient of 30.5%, which was not only higher than other age groups but also showed the greatest year-over-year variation. For income-based quintiles, the Engel coefficient decreased as income increased up to the third quintile, with the lowest income quintile having a high Engel coefficient of 31.9% in 2015 compared to 25.2% for the highest quintile. For grains, older households (60+ years) and low-income households (first quintile), as well as those in rural areas and single-person households, had a relatively high expenditure share. Over time, the gap in grain expenditure share based on household head's age increased. Households with heads aged 30 had the lowest grain expenditure share of 8.2%, while those with heads aged 40 showed a significant decrease from 21.4% in 1990 to 9.3% in 2015. In contrast, households with heads aged 60 or older maintained a high share, albeit with minimal change between 1990 and 2015. Meat consumption was higher for households with heads aged 40–50, those in higher income quintiles (4th and 5th), and households in urban areas with two or more members. Meat expenditure decreased after the 2000s, particularly for younger households. The share of meat in household budgets increased from 17.7% in 1995 to 18.6% by 2015, despite overall expenditure on meat decreasing.

For each configuration, we rank design choices by their performance, deeming performance to be tied when the difference ϵ < 0.02 (ϵ < 0.001 for PPI site prediction). We collect rankings over all configurations and report the mean ranking and their smoothed distribution for each task with bar and violin plots, respectively (lower is better). An average ranking score of 1 indicates the design choice invariably results in the highest performance over other possibilities in its category.

The tandem catalyst exhibits higher CO2 conversion and C2+ selectivity compared to the single-phase catalysts due to the synergistic effect of the core-shell structure.

The free-text responses from directors and investors highlight the importance of these factors in determining CEO compensation, with directors emphasizing the need to consider industry conditions and investors focusing on the alignment of CEO and shareholder interests. The responses also suggest that the current compensation practices are influenced by fairness considerations and the desire to attract and retain top talent, rather than purely economic principles. The mismatch between investors' preferences and directors' views on long-term incentives and relative performance evaluation is an interesting finding that highlights the complexity of CEO compensation decisions. The survey results indicate that directors prioritize fairness and industry conditions over purely economic principles, while investors focus on alignment and long-term performance.

According to the text, for a replacement trial, the non-inferiority margin at study design would be based on the assumed magnitude of the other benefits. Because the magnitude of the other benefits is investigated by collecting secondary outcomes during the trial, revising the margin before conducting the final analysis of the primary outcome is logical. This procedure is not commonly done at present. The procedure would require steps to ensure that the analysis of the secondary outcomes was conducted without access to the primary outcome data, with subsequent consideration of how the non-inferiority margin might consequently be modified. One approach could be to define the relation between the level of other benefits observed and the margin before the start of the trial. If there is one key benefit of the new treatment, or if the benefits can be summarised as a score, then the relation could be plotted in a graph similar to that in figure 2. In figure 2, a potential relation is illustrated for the BLISTER trial. Whereas the original trial used two different values for the non-inferiority margin (for the alternative option or the replacement) at each of two values of the additional benefit (reduction in mortality), the graph shows how the value for the non-inferiority margin could be specified across a range of measured values for the prespecified additional benefit. This approach mimics the non-inferiority frontier method to modify the non-inferiority margin based on the risk in the control arm found in a trial, which could potentially be adapted to respond to the magnitude of other benefits seen in the trial. Therefore, the statement is False. The non-inferiority margin for a replacement trial is not usually updated based on the efficacy observed during the trial.

Therefore, these findings raise concerns regarding the prolonged use of hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stone prevention. Allopurinol should be started at 100 mg once per day and increased gradually to 100 mg three times per day. There is no evidence that combination therapy with thiazide diuretics or alkaline citrates is more effective than monotherapy. Allopurinol is one of the mainstays of therapy for patients with calcium stones, but most patients with uric acid stones have acidic urine that requires treatment with alkaline citrates. Citrate supplements are not only used for calcium stones but also for uric acid stones (with a urine pH target of 6.0 to 7.5 or higher) and cystine stones (with a urine pH target of 7.0 to 7.5 or higher). The preferred dietary salt supplement is potassium citrate, with a target dose of 5 to 12 g per day. The starting dose should be 9 g per day, divided into three doses and taken within 30 min of a meal before bed—a snack. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal problems. Potassium citrate supplementation can correct low serum potassium levels caused by thiazide diuretics, but there is no evidence that combination therapy is more effective than either drug alone. Sodium citrate is an alternative to citrate supplementation, but the resulting excretion of sodium and calcium may partially offset the desired effect. Unsweetened soda is a tastier and less expensive alternative to citrate supplements. Although there is no direct evidence of its effectiveness in preventing stone recurrence, the dilution of lemon juice in water should help patients meet the recommended fluid intake. If medication or citrate supplementation is prescribed, serum potassium levels (for patients taking thiazide diuretics or potassium citrate) and liver enzymes (allopurinol) should be monitored to detect potentially serious adverse effects. Potassium levels should be monitored before prescription, within two weeks of prescription, and then every 12 months (earlier if illness occurs or another medication is added). Urinary acidification has been proposed for the prophylaxis of infection stones, but long-term acidification is difficult to achieve in urine infected by urease-producing bacteria. Urease inhibitors lead to the prevention and/or dissolution of stones and encrustations in patients with infection by urea-splitting bacteria, but their use is limited by their toxicity. Furthermore, the administration of citrate salts involves an increase in the value of nucleation pH (pHn). This is the pH value at which calcium and magnesium phosphate crystallization occurs, in a greater way than the corresponding increase in the urinary pH due to its alkalinizing effect and resulting in a reduction of the risk of struvite crystallization. It has been seen that Pioglitazone protects against CaOx crystals by promoting M2-like Mj polarization and decreasing renal CaOx crystal deposition and inflammatory damage in murine bone marrow-derived Mj in vitro and in CaOx nephrocalcinosis mouse models in vivo. Previous studies demonstrated that curcumin (an antioxidant) alleviated COM crystal deposition in the mouse kidney through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic activities. In addition to this, a new study was carried out about the role of vitexin in the prevention of nephrolithiasis. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of vitexin involved anti-pyroptotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and EMT suppressive activities. The results of Ding et al. confirm the protective role of vitexin in nephrolithiasis through the attenuation of NLRP3 activation and the GSDMD-related pyroptosis form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis mediates nephrolithiasis and is activated when renal epithelial cells are exposed to oxalate. The study found that the administration of vitexin significantly reduced the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and prevented the progression of nephrolithiasis. Therefore, vitexin may be a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of nephrolithiasis.
