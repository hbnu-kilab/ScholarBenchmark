The article also introduces the concept of Turing-Chomsky Compression (TCC), which is a principle of language design that relates the FEP to syntactic structure building. The authors argue that TCC can provide a principled explanation for the efficiency and complexity of language, and that it can be used to derive various linguistic phenomena, such as grammaticality judgments and language acquisition. The article also discusses the relationship between TCC and other theories of language, including minimalist syntax and active inference, and highlights the potential of TCC to provide a new perspective on the nature of language and its relationship to the human mind and brain."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Economy principle", "model_answer": "Economy principle"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}

The optimal sorbent replacement time is influenced by the degradation rate and form, with exponential degradation resulting in a minimum carbon footprint. The study also highlights the importance of considering sorbent degradation in DAC economic modeling to determine the replacement time that leads to the highest climate benefits.

However, this effect was short-lived, and by the second half of the sample period, the globe ratings no longer had a significant impact on fund flows. The analysis suggests that investors initially valued ESG considerations, but as they became aware of the trade-off between ESG and performance, they began to prioritize performance over sustainability. Funds that engaged in high ESG trading underperformed, and this underperformance was driven by their trades of high and low ESG stocks.
