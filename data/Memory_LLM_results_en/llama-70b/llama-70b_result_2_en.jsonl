The authors show that a local Carrollian conformal field S2+ must exist in the theory to capture the positive-helicity subsubleading soft graviton theorem, and that this field generates an infinite tower of Carrollian conformal primaries Sk+ that satisfy null-state conditions. The symmetry algebra of the CarrCFT is found to be the semi-direct product of the chiral Virasoro algebra and the wedge sub-algebra of w1+∞, which is consistent with the results of CCFT. The authors also demonstrate that the CarrCFT Ward identity of S2+ encodes the subsubleading soft graviton theorem, and that the infinite number of soft graviton theorems can be interpreted as the Ward identities of the members of the infinite tower of Carrollian conformal primaries Sk+.

This method allows for the integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data from different datasets and technologies, enabling the identification of cell types and their corresponding gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles. The method is based on a \"bridge\" dataset that contains both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, which is used to transfer information between the two modalities. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by applying it to several datasets, including a human lung scRNA-seq dataset and a COVID-19 scRNA-seq dataset. They also compare their method to other existing methods, such as multiVI and Cobolt, and show that it outperforms them in terms of accuracy and robustness.
