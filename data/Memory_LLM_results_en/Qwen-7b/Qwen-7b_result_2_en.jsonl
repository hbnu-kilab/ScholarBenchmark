Key findings include:\n\n1. **Conditional Probabilities**: The probability of finding super-Earths in systems with cold Jupiters is 66%, and the probability of finding cold Jupiters in systems with super-Earths is 15.9%. These probabilities increase with higher stellar metallicity.\n\n2. **Implications for Planet Formation**: The strong correlation between super-Earths and cold Jupiters suggests that in-situ formation models are more likely for super-Earths, while migration models are better suited for hot Jupiters. High-metallicity stars are more likely to host both types of planets.\n\n3. **Planetary Multiplicity and Metallicity**: Systems with cold Jupiters tend to have fewer planets within 400-day orbits, indicating a paucity of inner planets. This is consistent with the idea that cold Jupiters can disrupt inner planetary systems.\n\n4. **Rare Solar System Analogues**: The study estimates that only about 3% of Sun-like stars host solar system analogues (both a terrestrial and a long-period giant planet).\n\n5. **Exoplanet Archive Analysis**: Data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and The Data & Analysis Center for Exoplanets (DACE) support the observed correlations and provide insights into the formation and distribution of exoplanets.", "model_answer": "5. **Exoplanet Archive Analysis**: Data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and The Data & Analysis Center for Exoplanets (DACE) support the observed correlations and provide insights into the formation and distribution of exoplanets."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "0.066", "model_answer": "0.066"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['b']", "model_answer": "['b']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "a", "model_answer": "a"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}

However, the presence of income and gender inequalities significantly reduces these impacts.\n\n2. **Static Marginal Impacts**: Without moderation, environmental technology, environmental tax, globalization, and education expenditure show positive impacts on energy transition. However, when moderation is considered, these impacts are reduced, indicating that governance quality is less effective in the presence of inequalities.\n\n3. **Dynamic Marginal Impacts**: Over time, the marginal impacts of these factors gradually improve, but the presence of low governance quality and high inequalities hampers this improvement.\n\n4. **Extreme Marginal Impacts**: Under extreme conditions, the impacts of governance quality and inequalities on energy transition are most pronounced.

Key findings include:\n\n1. **Spatial Patterns**: Cultivated land density is higher in plains and northern regions, with significant global and local autocorrelation. Mean patch size (MPS) and area-weighted mean shape index (AWMSI) show regional variations, indicating different agricultural practices and policies.\n\n2. **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson's correlation coefficients reveal that cultivated land density and AWMSI have significant weak to medium negative correlations in some regions, suggesting more rational land use. Cultivated land density and MPS show generally significant weak to medium positive correlations, indicating larger agricultural scales.\n\n3. **Clustering Characteristics**: Using k-means clustering, seven types of CLF are identified, each with distinct characteristics. Type F (high density, low AWMSI, high MPS) is valued and protected, while types B and D (low MPS) require land circulation and consolidation.\n\n4. **Driving Factors**: The random forest model identifies elevation, slope, distance to urban areas, farming distance, GDP, and population as key factors driving CLF, with slope being the dominant factor in northern and southern regions.\n\nThese analyses provide insights into the complex dynamics of cultivated land use and fragmentation in China.", "model_answer": "These analyses provide insights into the complex dynamics of cultivated land use and fragmentation in China."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Land use policies", "model_answer": "Land use policies"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['b', 'c']", "model_answer": "['b', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "a", "model_answer": "a"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}
