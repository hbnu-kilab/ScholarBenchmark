Key findings include:\n\n1. **Conditional Probabilities**: The probability of finding super-Earths in systems with cold Jupiters is significantly higher (66%) compared to systems without cold Jupiters. Similarly, the presence of cold Jupiters increases the likelihood of warm Jupiters (25%).\n\n2. **Metallicity Dependence**: These probabilities show a strong dependence on stellar metallicity, with higher probabilities for metal-rich stars.\n\n3. **Planetary Multiplicity**: Systems with cold Jupiters tend to have fewer planets within 400-day orbits, indicating a potential suppression effect on inner planetary systems.\n\n4. **Implications for Formation Models**: The observed correlations suggest that in-situ formation models are more likely for super-Earths, while migration models are better suited for hot Jupiters. Cold Jupiters and super-Earths are strongly correlated, supporting the idea that high-metallicity conditions favor both planet types.\n\n5. **Rarity of Solar System Analogues**: The study estimates that only about 3% of Sun-like stars host systems with cold Jupiters but no super-Earths, indicating the rarity of solar system analogues.\n\nThese results provide insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems, particularly the roles of metallicity and giant planets in shaping these systems.", "model_answer": "These results provide insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems, particularly the roles of metallicity and giant planets in shaping these systems."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "0.066", "model_answer": "0.066"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['b']", "model_answer": "['b']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "a", "model_answer": "a"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}

The initial complexation step can lead to the formation of empty LNPs due to lipid self-precipitation, while the dialysis step promotes uniform distribution of payloads. The study proposes that the packing density transitions from surface to core loading as LNP size increases, with a maximum packing density dictating the payload capacity."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Size-exclusion chromatography", "model_answer": "Size-exclusion chromatography"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "a", "model_answer": "a"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}

Key points include:\n\n1. **Emission Inventories and Methods**: Emission inventories should be harmonized, with the Tourism Satellite Accounts and Environmental-Economic Input-Output (EEIO) models recommended for robust assessments. EEIO provides a comprehensive view of emissions, including long-lived greenhouse gases, and allows for differentiated consideration of emission sources.\n\n2. **Sub-National Emissions**: Calculating emissions at sub-national scales is complex, with various approaches and data availability challenges. EEIO has been used in several regions but often omits international aviation emissions.\n\n3. **Mitigation Strategies**: Mitigation efforts need to be significant yet non-disruptive. Regulatory and market-based policies are crucial, with carbon taxes and subsidies reduction being key. Strategies include avoiding, reducing, and substituting fossil energy use, especially in aviation, automobility, and water transport.\n\n4. **Transport Sector**: Subsidies and cost distortions in transport need to be addressed. Reducing subsidies and internalizing carbon costs can lead to a decline in transport demand. Speed reductions and technology innovation (e.g., alternative fuels, electric drives) are also important.\n\n5. **Consumer Behavior**: Marketing efforts should focus on reducing emissions, such as promoting domestic tourism and longer stays. Demarketing and de-growth strategies may be necessary for some destinations.\n\n6. **Policy Hierarchy**: Prioritize policies based on impact assessments, focusing on high-emission subsectors and avoiding, reducing, or substituting fossil energy use.", "model_answer": "6. **Policy Hierarchy**: Prioritize policies based on impact assessments, focusing on high-emission subsectors and avoiding, reducing, or substituting fossil energy use."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Aircraft technology", "model_answer": "Aircraft technology"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}

Key findings include:\n\n1. **WTP Insensitivity to Impact**: Both private and dedicated impact investors show similar WTP levels regardless of the impact level of the investment.\n2. **Replication with MTurk Participants**: Replications using MTurk participants confirm the main findings, with no significant differences in WTP between low and high impact treatments.\n3. **Experience and Comparability**: Neither experience in evaluating impact information nor the ability to compare multiple investment options significantly affects investors' WTP.\n\nThese results challenge traditional models of altruistic behavior and suggest that other factors, such as positive emotions associated with choosing sustainable investments, may play a more significant role.", "model_answer": "These results challenge traditional models of altruistic behavior and suggest that other factors, such as positive emotions associated with choosing sustainable investments, may play a more significant role."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Not specified", "model_answer": "Not specified"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "c", "model_answer": "c"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}

The broad Hα survey captures the highest extremes of previous estimates, highlighting the complementarity with previous studies. The findings suggest that models need substantial changes to explain lower SMBH masses and higher accretion efficiencies. The study also notes that while the number density of BL Hα emitters is higher than extrapolated quasar UV LFs, it is in agreement with X-ray studies, indicating a different AGN class.

Many non-Higgs operators also receive stringent bounds due to their running into Z-pole observables.\n\n4. **Implications**: These results suggest that ongoing and future experiments can either rule out or provide evidence for specific NP models, enhancing our understanding of the electroweak structure and flavor dynamics.", "model_answer": "4. **Implications**: These results suggest that ongoing and future experiments can either rule out or provide evidence for specific NP models, enhancing our understanding of the electroweak structure and flavor dynamics."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "8%", "model_answer": "8%"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "a", "model_answer": "a"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}
