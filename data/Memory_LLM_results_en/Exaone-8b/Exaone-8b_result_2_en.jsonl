LIN-5/NuMA forces initially favor short-axis alignment, which is corrected by an anaphase rotation driven by NMY-2/Myosin activity.\n\n2. **Mechanism of Rotation**: The rotation is linked to the formation and tension of the cytokinetic ring during cytokinesis. NMY-2/Myosin generates internal stresses that create a torque against the rigid eggshell, causing the entire cell to rotate and align the spindle with the long axis.\n\n3. **Generalizability**: Similar mechanisms are proposed to apply to mouse zygotes, where contractility in the cytokinetic ring also drives spindle alignment with the long axis, even in compressed conditions.

{"id": "1229", "results": {"summarization": {"model_original_answer": "The study examines the impact of the Associated Press (AP) ban on using the term \"illegal immigrant\" in media coverage, employing a difference-in-differences analysis across various media outlets. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Term Usage Reduction**: Outlets with higher reliance on AP content (AP intensity) showed a significant reduction in using the term \"illegal immigrant\" post-ban, with a 17% decrease associated with higher AP intensity.\n   \n2. **Robustness**: The results are robust to different measures of AP intensity, alternative transformations, and placebo tests using Reuters intensity, indicating a direct effect of the AP ban.\n\n3. **Outlet Ideology and Size**: The ban led to a notable decline in term usage across different ideological leanings and outlet sizes, though the effect was slightly larger for more left-leaning outlets. Significant diffusion occurred regardless of readership levels.\n\n4. **Public Opinion Impact**: By analyzing survey data from the CCES electoral survey, the study suggests that exposure to newspapers with higher AP intensity correlated with reduced use of the controversial term among respondents, potentially influencing public views on immigration policy without significantly altering overall immigration coverage volume, slant, or sentiment.\n\nOverall, the ban effectively altered media language use, particularly in content heavily influenced by AP dispatches, with measurable effects on public discourse around immigration policy.", "model_answer": "Overall, the ban effectively altered media language use, particularly in content heavily influenced by AP dispatches, with measurable effects on public discourse around immigration policy."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Undocumented individuals", "model_answer": "Undocumented individuals"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'c', 'd']", "model_answer": "['a', 'c', 'd']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "d", "model_answer": "d"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}
