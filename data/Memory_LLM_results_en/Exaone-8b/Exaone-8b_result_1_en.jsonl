Key points include:\n\n1. **Symmetry Algebra**: The CarrCFT containing a field \\( S^+_2 \\) satisfying \\( \\xi_{\\bar{z}} S^+_2 = 0 = \\xi S^+_2 \\) (where \\( \\xi \\) is the scaling dimension) generates a symmetry algebra that includes a wedge sub-algebra of the \\( \\hat{w}^{1+\\infty} \\) Kac-Moody algebra, combined with the Virasoro algebra. This algebra arises purely from Carrollian conformal symmetry arguments without relying on bulk gravitational details.\n\n2. **Infinite Tower of Fields**: The presence of \\( S^+_2 \\) necessitates the existence of an infinite tower of Carrollian conformal primaries \\( S^+_k \\) (for \\( k \\geq 2 \\)). These fields encode an infinite number of soft graviton theorems, extending beyond the leading and subleading orders.\n\n3. **Soft Graviton Theorems**: The Ward identities of the field \\( S^+_2 \\) capture the positive-helicity subsubleading soft graviton theorem. The entire infinite tower \\( S^+_k \\) encodes further soft theorems up to higher orders, consistent with the universal soft factorization and expansion found in bulk gravity theories.\n\n4. **Global Symmetries**: While \\( S^+_2 \\) introduces four additional global symmetries (non-local in time), no new independent global constraints are imposed beyond the ten universal Poincaré symmetries and those from \\( S^+_1 \\) and \\( T \\). This implies that the infinite tower of fields does not impose additional constraints on the bulk massless S-matrices.\n\n5. **Holographic Interpretation**: The findings suggest a holographic connection between the Carrollian conformal structure and bulk gravitational soft theorems, indicating that the \\( \\hat{w}^{1+\\infty} \\) symmetry algebra might be a fundamental quantum symmetry in gravity theories, similar to the role of \\( \\hat{w}^{1+\\infty} \\) in Celestial CFTs.\n\n6. **Future Directions**: Potential future work includes exploring the existence of opposite-spin counterparts of \\( S^+_2 \\), resolving issues related to double soft limits of opposite helicities, and constructing explicit examples of such CarrCFTs.

Key findings include:\n\n1. **Alignment Mechanism**: In *C. elegans* AB cells, the mitotic spindle aligns with the long axis of the cell via a rotation driven by actomyosin contractility (NMY-2/Myosin) during anaphase, correcting any initial misalignment during metaphase. This rotation is facilitated by the formation and tension of the cytokinetic ring.\n\n2. **Role of Cortical Forces**: LIN-5/NuMA-mediated cortical pulling forces tend to align the spindle with the short axis during metaphase, which is counteracted by the subsequent NMY-2/Myosin-driven rotation ensuring long axis alignment.\n\n3. **Physical Model**: The rotation is explained by internal stresses generating torque against the rigid eggshell, allowing the embryo to rotate freely within it. This model predicts the speed of rotation based on cytokinetic ring tension and aligns with experimental observations.\n\n4. **Generalizability**: The actomyosin-dependent mechanism observed in *C. elegans* AB cells appears to be generalizable to early cell divisions, as evidenced by similar long axis alignment in compressed mouse zygotes, suggesting a conserved principle in early embryonic cell divisions.\n\nThese insights provide a deeper understanding of how geometric constraints and cellular forces coordinate to ensure proper cell division orientation in early development.", "model_answer": "These insights provide a deeper understanding of how geometric constraints and cellular forces coordinate to ensure proper cell division orientation in early development."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Cell polarity cues", "model_answer": "Cell polarity cues"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "d", "model_answer": "d"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}
