MEDIC outperforms other large language models (LLMs) like T5-FineTuned and Claude in minimizing near-miss events, which are errors that could potentially harm patients.\n\nMEDIC's success stems from its unique three-stage process: rule-based formatting, AI-powered extraction of core components, and assembly using a medication database (ùíüùíüMedCat) and safety guardrails. These guardrails prevent MEDIC from generating directions that conflict with existing knowledge or lack essential information.\n\nWhile LLMs like ChatGPT4 and Gemini Pro show promise, they still struggle with generating accurate and safe medication directions without extensive fine-tuning or prompting.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of human-in-the-loop evaluation and feedback for refining AI systems like MEDIC in real-world settings.

The metallicity increases with increasing V content up to x=0.8, then decreases at x=1.\n* XANES and EXAFS data show that the Re-S bond length decreases with increasing V content, while the V-S bond length decreases due to oxidation at higher V content.\n* The HER performance of the alloys is enhanced compared to pure ReS2 and VS2, with lower overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm-2.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates the successful synthesis and characterization of Re1-xVxS2 alloy nanosheets with tunable properties, making them promising candidates for electrocatalytic applications.\n", "model_answer": "Overall, the study demonstrates the successful synthesis and characterization of Re1-xVxS2 alloy nanosheets with tunable properties, making them promising candidates for electrocatalytic applications."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Increase", "model_answer": "Increase"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n", "model_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b\n", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1 \n\n", "model_answer": "1"}}}
