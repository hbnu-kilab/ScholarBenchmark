The study focuses on the moderating effect of internal R&D activities on the relationship between digitalization and innovation. The analysis is based on a sample of 2,854 SMEs from the Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) dataset. The study finds that digitalization has a positive effect on product and process innovations in SMEs, regardless of their size. However, the impact of digitalization on innovation is weakened by internal R&D activities. The study also finds that SMEs with a higher level of digitalization are more likely to introduce new products and processes, and that big data analytics has a positive effect on product and process innovations. The study suggests that SMEs without in-house R&D activities may benefit more from digitalization, as they can leverage digital technologies to create new products and processes.", "model_answer": "This study investigates the impact of digitalization on product and process innovations in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany.

This approach reinforces the idea that whiteness is the default racial identity in the UK. The initiative's emphasis on shared values and a shared history also implies that integration into the majority society is a one-way process, rather than a reciprocal exchange. This approach is criticized for being assimilationist and for ignoring the historical context of colonialism and racism.
