The findings underscore the importance of considering sorbent degradation in economic models to minimize both costs and environmental impact, providing guidelines for optimizing DAC processes."}}}

The NR group, which had AI assistance removed, showed higher flag rates and lower relatedness scores, indicating a decline in feedback quality. The SR group, using a self-monitoring checklist instead of AI, showed improvements in flag rates and similarity scores but no significant difference in comment length. The SAI group, combining AI and self-monitoring, did not show significant improvements over the AI-only group. The study suggests that AI prompts significantly impact student feedback quality and that self-monitoring checklists can partially mitigate the loss of AI support.

It outperforms fully supervised models and existing generalist approaches like CLIP and BLIP. The study includes an ablation study on the data engine, showing that increasing the number of tags and training images significantly improves performance. However, RAM struggles with abstract tasks and fine-grained classifications and may reflect dataset biases. Future improvements could involve scaling up the training dataset and enhancing the model's capacity."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Recognize and localize objects", "model_answer": "Recognize and localize objects"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'c']", "model_answer": "['a', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "d", "model_answer": "d"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}
