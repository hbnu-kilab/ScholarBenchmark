This suppression is approximately 25% when integrated over \\( p_T \\).\n\n2. **Nonprompt Production:** The nonprompt (decay of B-hadrons) ψ(2S) to J/ψ production ratio is consistent with unity, as expected since nuclear effects primarily impact b-hadron production rather than their decays.\n\n3. **Model Comparisons:** The observed suppression can be described by models involving late-stage interactions that preferentially affect ψ(2S) mesons over J/ψ mesons, such as the Comover model and a combined CGC and improved Color Evaporation Model (GCG+ICEM).\n\n4. **Implications:** These results are crucial for understanding factorization breaking in nuclear collisions, which is essential for interpreting quarkonium data in heavy-ion collisions like PbPb at the LHC.\n\nThe data provide detailed cross-section ratios and nuclear modification factors, supporting the need for refined theoretical models to explain the differential behavior of quarkonium states in different collision environments.", "model_answer": "The data provide detailed cross-section ratios and nuclear modification factors, supporting the need for refined theoretical models to explain the differential behavior of quarkonium states in different collision environments."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "0.45 mb", "model_answer": "0.45 mb"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}

Key points include:\n\n1. **Affective Proximity and Credibility:** Local journalists often experience higher emotional engagement due to their close ties to the conflict, which can be perceived as bias by foreign colleagues who maintain a more detached stance. This leads to an epistemic injustice where local professionals face credibility deficits based on their identity and emotional involvement.\n\n2. **Emotional Labor:** Local media professionals engage in significant emotional labor to balance their personal connections with professional objectivity, often suppressing emotions to maintain credibility. In contrast, foreign journalists are often granted more credibility due to their perceived detachment and association with prestigious media organizations.\n\n3. **Rationality of Emotions:** Emotions are multifaceted, combining cognitive evaluations, behavioral desires, and rational decision-making. Local journalists' emotional engagement can be seen as rational, aiding in understanding and reporting the truth, rather than just a hindrance.\n\n4. **Methodology:** The research is based on interviews and ethnographic observations with 36 media professionals across Ukraine and conflict zones in the Middle East, highlighting the complexities and challenges in conflict reporting and the systemic biases within the field.\n\nThe study challenges the notion that emotional involvement inherently undermines journalistic credibility, arguing instead for a more nuanced understanding of the role emotions play in informed and ethical reporting.", "model_answer": "The study challenges the notion that emotional involvement inherently undermines journalistic credibility, arguing instead for a more nuanced understanding of the role emotions play in informed and ethical reporting."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Decreases perceived neutrality, biases towards familiar groups", "model_answer": "Decreases perceived neutrality, biases towards familiar groups"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['b', 'c']", "model_answer": "['b', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}

Key points include:\n\n1. **Synthesis Methods**:\n   - **Hot Injection (HI) and Ligand-Assisted Reprecipitation (LARP)**: These methods are widely used for size-controlled synthesis of LHP QDs. HI offers better shape control but can yield 2D nanoplatelets at low temperatures, while LARP is less common for precise size tuning.\n   - **Size Control**: Achieved by adjusting parameters like Br/Pb ratio, reaction temperature, and ligand concentration. For example, using excess bromide ions and lower temperatures can produce smaller, more confined QDs.\n   - **Ligands**: Strongly binding ligands like oleylphosphonic acid (OLPA) improve stability and control over morphology and size, enabling the synthesis of highly monodisperse QDs.\n   - **High-Throughput Approaches**: Data-driven and machine learning methods, including robotic workstations and microfluidic platforms, are being explored to accelerate the optimization of QD synthesis, though these are more developed for weakly-confined NCs.\n\n2. **Optical Properties**:\n   - **Quantum Confinement Effects**: Strong confinement below the exciton Bohr diameter (e.g., ~7 nm for FAPbBr3) leads to discrete energy levels, observable in absorption spectra as higher-order excitonic transitions.\n   - **Charge Carrier Dynamics**: The size reduction enhances exciton binding energy and affects hot carrier relaxation processes, crucial for applications like LEDs and photovoltaics.\n   - **Emission Tuning**: Size-dependent tuning of emission wavelengths allows for a wide range of colors, from UV to red, without phase separation, beneficial for display technologies.\n\n3. **Applications**:\n   - **Optoelectronics**: Strongly-confined LHP QDs are promising for high-definition displays, LEDs, lasers, photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and photodetectors, especially in the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) range.\n   - **Biomedical Imaging**: High quantum yield QDs in the SWIR can be used for advanced bioimaging applications.\n   - **Flexible Devices**: Deposition on flexible substrates via low-temperature processing opens opportunities for wearable medical imaging devices and thin film transistors.\n\n4. **Challenges and Future Directions**:\n   - **Rational Design and AI**: Further development of data-mining, high-throughput synthesis, and machine learning to optimize and predict properties of strongly-confined QDs.\n   - **In Situ Characterization**: Enhanced real-time monitoring during synthesis to better understand and control reaction kinetics and crystal growth.\n\nOverall, the focus is on advancing the synthesis techniques, understanding optical properties, and expanding applications of strongly-confined LHP QDs, driven by the need for high-performance optoelectronic materials.", "model_answer": "Overall, the focus is on advancing the synthesis techniques, understanding optical properties, and expanding applications of strongly-confined LHP QDs, driven by the need for high-performance optoelectronic materials."}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'c']", "model_answer": "['a', 'c']"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}

However, stability concerns arise due to potential ion leaching in acidic or ionic environments.\n\n2. **Single-Atom Catalysts (SAC):**\n   - SACs, such as cobalt and nickel atoms supported on CN, significantly enhance ORR efficiency and reactivity by precisely modulating oxygen adsorption and improving charge separation. For instance, Ni SAC on porous CN achieved high H2O2 production rates, with detailed studies elucidating the role of specific active sites in reaction mechanisms.\n\n3. **Vacancy Engineering:**\n   - Introducing atomic vacancies (Cv, Nv, Sv) into materials like CN enhances light absorption, charge separation, and oxygen adsorption, leading to improved catalytic performance. For example, sulfur vacancies in ZnIn2S4 significantly boost H2O2 production rates. However, detailed mechanistic understanding and stability issues remain challenges.\n\n4. **Molecular-Level Design:**\n   - This approach involves optimizing monomers to improve photocatalyst performance:\n     - **Redox Reaction Units:** Designing specialized units like heptazine and triazine motifs in COFs enhances two-electron ORR efficiency, as seen in materials like HEP-TAPT-COF.\n     - **Donor-Acceptor (D-A) Configurations:** Polymers with D-A structures facilitate efficient charge transfer and separation, improving photocatalytic activity, as demonstrated in COF-based systems.\n     - **Linker Units:** Optimizing linker units to enhance electron mobility, such as using phenyl groups in CN and fully conjugated linkers in COFs, significantly boosts carrier dynamics and H2O2 production rates.\n\nThese strategies collectively aim to optimize electronic structures, carrier dynamics, and surface reactions, though they face challenges in stability, material synthesis complexity, and comprehensive empirical validation.

Key points include:\n\n1. **SED Fitting with PROSPECTOR**: The research employs the PROSPECTOR code for spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, which models both stellar populations and potential AGN contributions, distinguishing between sources with and without AGN activity based on mid-IR emission.\n\n2. **AGN Identification**: Radiative-mode AGN are identified by significant improvements in SED fits when AGN components are included and by a high AGN fraction (_fAGN,_16 > 10−3). This method identifies 3925 out of 30,470 radio-selected sources as AGN hosts, comparable to multi-code approaches.\n\n3. **Radio-Excess Classification**: The study uses the relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and 150 MHz radio luminosity to classify sources as radio-excess, indicating potential AGN activity. This approach leverages the low-frequency radio data from LoTSS, which is less affected by free-free emission.\n\n4. **Comparison with Previous Work**: The classification results using PROSPECTOR show good agreement with previous studies that used multiple SED fitting codes, validating the single-code approach.\n\n5. **Stellar Mass and SFR Estimates**: PROSPECTOR estimates of stellar mass and SFR are compared with those from other codes like MAGPHYS, showing general consistency, with PROSPECTOR providing more conservative estimates for high SFRs and AGN-dominated sources.\n\n6. **Implications for Radio Source Demographics**: The methodology provides insights into the demographics of different galaxy classes as a function of physical parameters, aiding in understanding the role of AGN and star formation in radio-loud galaxies.", "model_answer": "6. **Implications for Radio Source Demographics**: The methodology provides insights into the demographics of different galaxy classes as a function of physical parameters, aiding in understanding the role of AGN and star formation in radio-loud galaxies."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "100 μJy", "model_answer": "100 μJy"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['b', 'd']", "model_answer": "['b', 'd']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}

Key points include:\n\n1. **Governance and Coordination**: Ecosystems and platforms rely on specific governance structures to facilitate operations, attract partners, and align incentives. Centralized governance is common in platform-based ecosystems, while non-platform ecosystems may use multilateral arrangements. Failures can arise from issues like forking, splintering, and fragmentation, which disrupt interoperability and stability.\n\n2. **Functional Failures**: These occur when the system's integrity is compromised, leading to reduced joint value creation. Examples include operational failures in maintaining stable interfaces, and issues arising from the heterogeneity of cell types or exogenous stimuli responses, impacting overall functionality.\n\n3. **Distributional Failures**: These involve inequitable value distribution among ecosystem members, often due to orchestrators exploiting their power. This can lead to reduced incentives for participants to invest in quality contributions, fostering free-riding and undermining collective value creation.\n\n4. **Orchestrator Power and Abuse**: Central orchestrators wield significant power, which can be misused to capture disproportionate value, manipulate data, and control ecosystem dynamics, leading to both functional and distributional failures. This abuse necessitates regulatory scrutiny and potential intervention.\n\n5. **Regulatory Challenges**: Existing antitrust laws are inadequate for addressing platform and ecosystem issues, necessitating new analytical tools and regulatory approaches. Self-regulation, ex ante rule-setting, and ex post enforcement are proposed strategies to mitigate failures and ensure fair competition.\n\n6. **Future Research Directions**: The paper highlights the need for further research on decentralized governance, the trade-offs between different ecosystem designs, and the evolving impact of regulatory measures on platform and ecosystem structures.\n\nOverall, the analysis underscores the complex interplay between governance, value creation, and potential failures in modern digital ecosystems, emphasizing the critical role of balanced regulation and strategic design in sustaining their effectiveness.", "model_answer": "Overall, the analysis underscores the complex interplay between governance, value creation, and potential failures in modern digital ecosystems, emphasizing the critical role of balanced regulation and strategic design in sustaining their effectiveness."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Data centralization, increased attack surface, dependency on third parties", "model_answer": "Data centralization, increased attack surface, dependency on third parties"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}

{"id": "1229", "results": {"summarization": {"model_original_answer": "**Summary:**\n\nThe study examines the impact of the Associated Press (AP) ban on the use of the term \"illegal immigrant\" in media outlets. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Diffusion of the Ban:** Media outlets with higher AP intensity significantly reduced their use of \"illegal immigrant\" post-ban, with a 17% relative decrease for each standard deviation increase in AP intensity. The effect was driven primarily by AP-sourced content, not original articles.\n\n2. **Timing and Persistence:** The decline in term usage occurred precisely at the time of the ban announcement and persisted over time, consistent with the long-term nature of the AP's content influence.\n\n3. **Robustness:** Results were robust to various measures of AP intensity, alternative time periods for intensity calculation, and different definitions of the dependent variable, with a placebo test using Reuters intensity showing no significant effect.\n\n4. **Ideological Heterogeneity:** The impact was more pronounced in left-leaning outlets, though significant across most ideological quartiles. The effect on original content showed opposing trends by ideology, but was smaller in magnitude.\n\n5. **Outlet Size:** The diffusion effects were consistent across newspapers of different circulation sizes, indicating broad impact regardless of readership.\n\n6. **Other Coverage Aspects:** The ban had limited effects on overall immigration coverage volume, slant, or sentiment, beyond the specific term usage.\n\n7. **Public Opinion:** The study plans to explore how these changes in media language influenced public views on immigration policy using county-level data from the CCES survey, though specific results are not detailed in the provided text.", "model_answer": "7. **Public Opinion:** The study plans to explore how these changes in media language influenced public views on immigration policy using county-level data from the CCES survey, though specific results are not detailed in the provided text."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Undocumented", "model_answer": "Undocumented"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'd']", "model_answer": "['a', 'd']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "d", "model_answer": "d"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}
