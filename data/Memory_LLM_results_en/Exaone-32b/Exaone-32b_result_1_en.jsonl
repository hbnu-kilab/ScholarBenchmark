Financial incentives are seen as important for recognition and maintaining intrinsic motivation rather than just consumption utility.\n\n2. **Variable Pay:** The primary reason for offering variable pay is to motivate CEOs to improve long-term shareholder value, with additional emphasis on fairness, such as sharing risks with stakeholders and aligning pay with performance to maintain perceived fairness.\n\n3. **Constraints on Pay:** Directors face significant external constraints, particularly from shareholder approval and regulatory requirements, which often lead to lower pay levels and less tailored incentive structures. Investors emphasize the need for pay to be aligned with long-term value but also consider external pressures like employee and public perception.\n\n4. **Pay Structure:** The structure of pay is heavily influenced by the CEO's impact on firm performance, with less emphasis on risk aversion or firm-specific risk. Directors feel constrained by peer firm practices and regulatory expectations, while investors prefer more tailored, long-term incentives.\n\n5. **Long-term Incentives:** Investors believe that longer-term incentives would improve decision-making with minimal negative consequences, contrary to directors who are concerned about potential demotivation or retention issues.\n\n6. **Relative Performance Evaluation (RPE):** There is limited support for universally benchmarking CEO performance against peers due to practical challenges like defining appropriate peer groups and concerns about fairness, such as mirroring shareholder experiences.\n\nThe findings suggest a more nuanced model of CEO compensation that incorporates fairness concerns and multiple reference points for both CEOs and stakeholders, challenging traditional economic theories.", "model_answer": "The findings suggest a more nuanced model of CEO compensation that incorporates fairness concerns and multiple reference points for both CEOs and stakeholders, challenging traditional economic theories."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Aligns interests, performance incentives", "model_answer": "Aligns interests, performance incentives"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "a", "model_answer": "a"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}

It highlights the need for more detailed regional economic representations and better understanding of risk perception dynamics.\n\n6. **Policy Implications:** Targeted policies, such as early closure of customer-facing industries and enhanced support for low-income workers, can mitigate both health and economic impacts, especially in spontaneous behavioral change scenarios.", "model_answer": "6. **Policy Implications:** Targeted policies, such as early closure of customer-facing industries and enhanced support for low-income workers, can mitigate both health and economic impacts, especially in spontaneous behavioral change scenarios."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Increased unemployment due to lockdowns and economic slowdown", "model_answer": "Increased unemployment due to lockdowns and economic slowdown"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b', 'd']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b', 'd']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}

Key points include:\n\n1. **Sustainability Efforts and Market Dynamics**: Despite growth in sustainable product markets, there's no evidence of contraction in unsustainable product markets. For instance, while electric vehicle (EV) sales are increasing, they still represent a small fraction of total vehicle numbers due to the long lifespan of existing vehicles.\n\n2. **Corporate Sustainability and Consumerism**: Many corporate sustainability initiatives, while potentially improving eco-efficiency, often promote increased consumption, which can negate environmental benefits. Examples like Patagonia's campaigns show that such efforts can boost demand without reducing overall consumption.\n\n3. **Sustainable Entrepreneurship**: This approach involves creating social, environmental, and economic value simultaneously. Examples include B-Corporations like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's, and innovative solutions like LIXIL's Sato toilet, which address specific environmental issues while remaining profitable.\n\n4. **Business Model Transformation**: Transforming business models to be more sustainable, such as through circular economy practices (e.g., Napapijri's recyclable jackets) and renewable energy shifts (e.g., Ørsted's transition from fossil fuels to wind energy), can lead to significant environmental benefits. However, these changes must be coupled with broader regulatory support to address systemic issues.\n\n5. **Role of Regulation and Governments**: Narrow business cases often fail to drive substantial change, necessitating government intervention through regulation and policy to create incentives for radical business model shifts. Collaboration between businesses, governments, and other stakeholders is crucial.\n\n6. **Degrowth and Innovation**: Degrowth strategies, which focus on reducing consumption in harmful sectors, can be supported by innovative business models that emphasize service-based revenue over sales growth, as seen in companies like Napapijri.\n\n7. **Integrated Approach**: Moving forward, an \"all stakeholders win\" approach is advocated, where business cases for sustainability are broadened to include social, environmental, and economic value creation.

This heterogeneity is influenced by the initial complexation kinetics and subsequent purification steps.\n\n2. **Kinetic Assembly**: LNP assembly involves two main stages:\n   - **Complexation**: At low pH, rapid solvent mixing can lead to lipid self-precipitation, forming empty LNPs, while slower processes allow siRNA incorporation.\n   - **Dialysis**: At physiological pH, PEG lipids stabilize LNPs, limiting inter-LNP mass exchange and preserving initial heterogeneity, especially in formulations with higher PEG content.\n\n3. **PEG Influence**: Higher PEG content stabilizes LNPs early, reducing mass exchange and maintaining initial heterogeneity. Lower PEG content allows more uniform packing through extended mass exchange, leading to larger, more uniformly packed LNPs.\n\n4. **Structural Organization**: siRNA, helper lipids, and PEG lipids are likely associated in structural units, either on the LNP surface or within core inverted micelles, with evidence suggesting residual water pockets accommodate hydrophilic components.\n\n5. **Simulation Support**: Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations support the observed heterogeneity, predicting the evolution of LNP properties over time and confirming the role of initial complexation kinetics in determining final LNP composition and size distribution.", "model_answer": "5. **Simulation Support**: Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations support the observed heterogeneity, predicting the evolution of LNP properties over time and confirming the role of initial complexation kinetics in determining final LNP composition and size distribution."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)", "model_answer": "Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['b', 'c']", "model_answer": "['b', 'c']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0"}}}

Key points include:\n\n1. **SED Fitting with PROSPECTOR**: The research employs PROSPECTOR, an SED fitting code, to estimate physical properties like stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and dust luminosity for over 30,000 radio-detected sources. PROSPECTOR models account for both stellar populations and potential AGN contributions, providing more accurate classifications compared to codes that neglect AGN effects.\n\n2. **AGN Identification**: Radiative-mode AGN are identified using two criteria: significant improvement in fit quality when including AGN components, and a high AGN fraction (_fAGN,_16 > 10−3).

This relationship is applied to estimate the upper and lower limits of host galaxy masses for the quasars, assuming a flat spectral energy distribution (SED) in the relevant wavelength range.\n\n3. **Black Hole Masses:** Black hole masses in three quasars (J0731+4459, J1340+2813, and J2239+0207) are estimated using Hα and Hβ line widths, resulting in masses ranging from log(MBH [M☉]) = 8.5 to 9.4.\n\n4. **Balmer Break Analysis:** NIRSpec spectra analysis reveals no significant Balmer breaks, indicating minimal stellar continuum contribution from the host galaxies, suggesting that if present, these galaxies are not massive enough to maintain the local MBH–M* relation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The derived host galaxy masses for these high-redshift, luminous quasars appear to deviate significantly from the local MBH–M* relation, challenging the conventional theory of symbiotic growth between SMBHs and their host galaxies.

For instance, CoNOC (Co coordinated by N and O) shows improved *OOH adsorption and *O−O bond stabilization.\n\n4. **Second and Further CS Modifications**: Incorporating oxygen-containing groups (e.g., epoxy groups) in the second CS can further optimize binding energies, enhancing 2e− ORR.

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors (blocking PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3) show minimal efficacy in rejuvenating these cells.\n\n2. **Rejuvenation with 4-1BB Agonism:** Agonism of 4-1BB, but not OX40, significantly reinvigorates dysfunctional CD8+ T cells, enhancing their proliferation, effector functions (IFN-γ production, cytolysis), and ability to suppress HBV replication. This effect is more pronounced in a stem-like (Dys-TSL) subset expressing 4-1BB universally.\n\n3. **Heterogeneous T Cell Populations:** Intrahepatic priming generates a stable, heterogeneous pool of dysfunctional T cells, including stem-like (Dys-TSL) and two tissue-resident memory (Dys-TRM1 and Dys-TRM2) subsets. 4-1BB activation particularly benefits the Dys-TSL subset, promoting broader functional conversion across these populations.\n\n4. **Clinical Relevance:** In patients with HBeAg+ chronic HBV infection, 4-1BB activation shows the highest potential to rejuvenate dysfunctional CD8+ T cells, as evidenced by increased cytokine production and effector functions in vitro.\n\n5. **Mechanistic Insights:** 4-1BB agonism enhances key effector molecules and TCR signaling, overcoming functional deficits in dysfunctional T cells without significant proliferation, indicating a functional rather than proliferative mechanism.\n\nThese findings suggest that targeting 4-1BB could be a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance antiviral immunity in chronic HBV, particularly in early infection phases characterized by high viral load and low inflammation.", "model_answer": "These findings suggest that targeting 4-1BB could be a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance antiviral immunity in chronic HBV, particularly in early infection phases characterized by high viral load and low inflammation."}, "short_answer": {"model_original_answer": "Cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma", "model_answer": "Cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma"}, "multiple_select": {"model_original_answer": "['a', 'b']", "model_answer": "['a', 'b']"}, "multiple_choice": {"model_original_answer": "b", "model_answer": "b"}, "true_false": {"model_original_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1"}}}
