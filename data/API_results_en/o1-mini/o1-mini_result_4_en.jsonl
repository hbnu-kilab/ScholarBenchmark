Unlike previous research where willingness to pay increased steadily with monetary donations to charities, we found that when the impact isn't expressed in monetary terms, investors' willingness to pay does not rise consistently with the level of impact. This indicates that emotions, rather than calculated benefits, drive investors' decisions in such scenarios. As sustainable investing rapidly grows, there is a high risk of greenwashing, where financial institutions may focus more on appearing sustainable than on making meaningful contributions. To prevent this, we suggest that quantifying impacts in monetary terms could help ensure that investments effectively address societal challenges."}}}

It explains that increasing the size and code distance of error-correcting codes enhances the ability to detect and correct errors, provided the error rate remains below a specific threshold. When the error density is below this threshold, larger code distances exponentially reduce logical error rates, enabling reliable large-scale quantum computations.\n\nFault tolerance is defined as the ability to prevent single physical errors from spreading and causing multiple errors within a logical block. This is achieved through the use of transversal gates, which perform independent operations on each qubit in a code block, thereby limiting error propagation and ensuring that logical operations remain reliable.\n\nThe text delves into the implementation of surface codes in two-dimensional architectures, emphasizing the critical role of stabilizer measurements in maintaining qubit coherence and enabling logical operations like braiding and lattice surgery. It also discusses color codes, which offer a more versatile set of transversal gates without needing lattice rotations, making them suitable for programmable logical algorithms.\n\nAdditionally, the paragraph highlights the importance of advanced decoding techniques, such as correlated decoding, to effectively manage and correct errors in complex quantum circuits. It addresses the challenges of classically simulating certain quantum circuits, like Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time (IQP) circuits, and uses cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) to assess quantum advantage.\n\nFinally, the comparison between logical and physical qubit implementations demonstrates that logical circuits exhibit higher error tolerance and better performance, underscoring the benefits of using fault-tolerant structures in quantum computing."}}}
