By examining electroweak, flavor, and collider data and consistently including renormalization group effects, the study establishes conservative lower bounds on the effective new physics scale for each operator. The results indicate that many operator bounds exceed several TeV, but with additional assumptions, an effective scale as low as 1.5 TeV is achievable. The research highlights the significant potential of future experiments, particularly the FCC-ee collider, to enhance constraints on these operators by an order of magnitude, thereby either ruling out or providing evidence for a broad class of new physics models. Additionally, improved precision in flavor observables is essential for probing the flavor orientation of third-generation fermions, making flavor-changing processes a promising avenue for discovering new physics."}}}

In contrast, inflowing gas shows a wide range of densities, temperatures, and metallicities, representing both pristine intergalactic medium and merger-accreted gas, and is the main contributor to CGM emission, especially in [CII]. The [OIII]/[CII] ratio in Ponos is around 0.17, lower than typical high-redshift values and similar to local starburst galaxies, suggesting different physical conditions.
