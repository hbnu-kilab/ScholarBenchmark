Active tension in the cytokinetic ring helps correct spindle misalignment, enabling the spindle to align with the long axis, especially when cortical pulling forces on astral microtubules aren't dominant. In cases where cortical forces dominate, spindles initially align with the short axis but a rotation aligns them with the long axis, driven by tension in the cytokinetic ring. This research demonstrates that cell rotation to align actomyosin-generated forces with cell shape is a central aspect of spindle positioning and division orientation in early development, consistent across different species."}}}
