The optimal calcium to fluoride ratio for crystallization was determined as 0.5, though higher than theoretical ratios indicate some calcium loss. Upflow velocity impacts fluoride removal, where moderate velocities (20-40 m/h) maintain high efficiency, but very low or high velocities hinder performance. Higher seed bed heights improve fluoride removal up to a point, beyond which efficiency plateaus. Smaller seed particles enhance removal due to increased surface area. Influent fluoride concentration is critical, with optimal removal observed at 300-10,000 mg/L. High calcium concentration, substantial seed height, and moderate upflow velocity yield the best fluoride removal outcomes.

Different principles for carbon inventory allocation—production, consumption, and destination—help determine accountability in emission inventories. Emission calculations for the tourism sector are complex due to various components such as aviation, imports, and international travel that must be accounted for. Harmonizing emission inventory frameworks is essential, and the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) combined with tourism-specific models is recommended for comprehensive assessments.
