The RT model, which factors in cooling and feedback processes, leads to lower [OIII] emission and alters the gas phase conditions. Analysis of density–temperature phase diagrams and emission maps reveals that different gas phases—from the dense, star-forming regions in the disc and mergers to the diffuse CGM—contribute distinctly to the observed line luminosities. Extended [CII] emission in the CGM traces features like accreting filaments and tidal tails, while CO remains concentrated in the dense disc regions.

Quantum confinement in these QDs enhances electron–hole interactions, leading to a splitting of exciton states into triplet and singlet configurations. Unlike conventional QDs, where the ground state is dark, perovskite QDs have a bright ground state due to their unique band structure and the Rashba effect. This results in unusually fast photoluminescence lifetimes (200–300 ps at 4 K), and in cubic perovskite QDs, structural distortions further split the bright triplet state into three sublevels with orthogonal polarizations."}}}

While previous studies found a linear relationship when impact is expressed in monetary terms, these experiments—where impact is measured in CO₂ savings—show that investors do not pay significantly more for investments with higher impact. Instead, investors appear driven more by an emotional warm glow than by calculative evaluations of impact. The study also finds that inconsistent valuation might lead to greenwashing, as financial institutions have incentives to market investments that look sustainable without delivering proportional environmental benefits. Robustness checks and multiple replications confirm that while investors do prefer sustainable investments over conventional ones, their willingness-to-pay does not scale with the actual level of impact."}}}

Using dynamic difference-in-differences and two-stage least squares methods, the study shows that media outlets—especially those relying on AP content—substantially reduced their use of the banned term after the policy change. The analysis reveals that the decline is stronger in outlets with higher AP intensity and varies by outlet ideology, with left-leaning media showing larger reductions in original content. Furthermore, by linking these changes to county-level newspaper circulation and survey data, the study finds that reduced use of the term is associated with lower support for restrictive immigration policies, such as increasing border security. Robustness checks, including placebo tests with Reuters content, confirm that the observed effects are specifically driven by the AP ban."}}}

Researchers further classify skills into seven communities (e.g., Finance & Legal, Software & Tech, Marketing) using network analysis and examine how supply, demand, and three measures of complementarity (number, diversity, and value of adjacent skills) determine skill value. The findings reveal that skills with lower supply, higher demand, and greater complementarity yield higher premiums, with these effects differing across communities.

In a controlled experiment, children watched one version of the animation and completed questionnaires assessing narrative engagement, wishful identification, and physical activity intention. Results showed that the Fantastical characters significantly boosted narrative engagement compared to the unambiguous design, while differences in wishful identification and physical activity intention were less clear.

Using negative binomial regression analysis, the research shows that features such as positive sentiment and exclamation marks significantly boost positive Facebook reactions (e.g., Likes and Love), while negative sentiment is linked to reactions like Sad and Angry. Even after controlling for topics and genres of news, stylistic choices in both formats have a distinct impact on engagement.

Using eye-tracking in 5‑month‑old twins, researchers measured two aspects: how frequently infants first looked at a face (face orienting) and the proportion of time they spent looking at faces (face preference). They found that face preference showed moderate heritability (46%), while face orienting had lower heritability (19%). Shared genetic influences helped explain the link between these measures, although no significant associations were found with polygenic scores for autism or ADHD. Additionally, only a weak link was observed between early face preference and later receptive vocabulary, suggesting that infants’ early visual attention may contribute subtly to social and language development."}}}

To improve this, the authors propose Directed Representation Optimization (DRO), a method that optimizes continuous safety prompts by moving query representations along an estimated refusal direction. Through a process of anchoring a low-dimensional representation space using controlled data, DRO adjusts the prompts to boost refusal rates for harmful inputs while reducing false refusals for harmless ones. Experiments on various benchmarks, including out-of-domain and jailbreak settings, demonstrate that DRO significantly enhances safeguarding performance without compromising the models’ general language capabilities."}}}
