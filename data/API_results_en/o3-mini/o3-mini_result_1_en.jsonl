Results revealed that children showed higher narrative engagement with the fantastical design compared to the unambiguous one, and mediation analysis indicated that narrative engagement and wishful identification helped translate this effect into greater intentions to be physically active. These findings suggest that using racially ambiguous and fantastical character features may enhance engagement and promote health-related behavior among diverse children."}}}
